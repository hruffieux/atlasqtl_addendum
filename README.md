## ATLASQTL addendum - Supplementary code repository on the hyperprior elicitation procedure

Supplementary code accompanying the paper:
Helene Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jorg Hager, Jamie Inshaw, Benjamin P. Fairfax, Sylvia Richardson, Leonardo Bottolo, A global-local approach for detecting hotspots in multiple-response regression, arXiv:1811.03334, 2018.

Contains a routine performing sensitivity analyses for the choices of the hyperparameters controlling the prior mean of the number of predictors associated with each response and its prior variance. The code can be readily adapted to generate and assess robustness under different problem scenarios.
