## ATLASQTL addendum - Hyperprior elicitation procedure

Supplementary code accompanying the paper:

Hélène Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jörg Hager, Jamie Inshaw, Benjamin P. Fairfax, Sylvia Richardson, Leonardo Bottolo, A global-local approach for detecting hotspots in multiple-response regression, arXiv:1811.03334, 2018.

Contains scripts for generic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of [ATLASQTL](https://github.com/hruffieux/atlasqtl) to the choice of hyperparameters controlling the prior mean and variance of the number of predictors associated with each response. The code can be readily adapted to serve user-specific problem scenarios and data.
